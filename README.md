## Detect Aukad 

Type anything and see if you have the AUKAD for it! Randomly generate responses, stats, and trophies based on your input. Packed with emojis, Easter eggs, and absurd humor â€” a totally chaotic browser game for fun and memes.

## How to Use

Pretty easy and simple, just like the game. Open this in a browser:

```
https://detect-aukad.onrender.com/
```
And boom â€” youâ€™re ready to unleash your Aukad! âš¡

## Tech Stack

Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Comes with a slick gradient + frosted container because style matters, even in nonsense games. ðŸ˜Ž

## License

MIT License â€” basically, do whatever you want. Seriously. I donâ€™t even know all the legal stuff, and you probably donâ€™t either.
